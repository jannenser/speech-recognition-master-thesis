Speech recognition and Neural machine translation for Swiss German dialect

## Speech recognition 
Implements a DNN model training and inference for transcribing both into Swiss German and Srandard German with WER = 35% and CER = 14%
DNN model architecture:


## Neural Machine Translation
Implements a Seq2Seq Attention model to translate the Swiss German into the Standard German with BLEU = 58.9
Implements SpellChecker to check if Swiss German can be transcribed into German easier
